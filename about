Since this program tests all kinds of compression utilities, it also depends on them.

List of utilities:

compress	(package name is usually 'ncompress')
gzip
bzip2
xz
lzma
lzop
zpipe

If one of the utilities is not available, the other tests will still run.

Since it is written in python3, it obviously requires python3
There is also a dependency on pipe viewer (pv), to display progress during benchmark runs
