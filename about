Since this program tests all kinds of compression utilities, it also depends on them.

List of utilities:

compress	(package name is usually 'mcompress')
gzip
bzip2
xz
lzma
lzop

Since it is written in python3, it obviously requires python3
There is also a dependency on pipe viewer (pv), to display progress during benchmark runs
